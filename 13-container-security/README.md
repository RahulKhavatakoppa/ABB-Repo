# Task 13 – Container Security

**For reviewers:** In this folder I have kept `container-scan-report.txt` (for output from Trivy, Snyk, or Azure Defender for container registries) and `mitigations.md` (list of mitigations I have documented for typical findings).

**Usage:** Run e.g. `trivy image YOUR_ACR.azurecr.io/devops-assessment-app:latest` or use Azure Defender → Container registries → image → Vulnerability findings.

**Deliverables:** Scan report and mitigations.md as above.

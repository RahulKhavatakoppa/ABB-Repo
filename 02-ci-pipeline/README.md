# Task 2 – CI Pipeline

**For reviewers:** In this folder I have kept `ci.yml` – the GitHub Actions workflow for build, unit test, and upload artifact. It triggers on push/PR to main or develop when `sample-app/` (or the workflow file) changes.

**Deliverables:** I have left `build-logs/` for the build and test log from a successful run (e.g. from the Actions tab after copying this workflow to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

**To run on GitHub:** Copy `ci.yml` to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

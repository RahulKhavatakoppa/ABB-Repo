# Build logs (Task 2)

**For reviewers:** I have left this folder for the CI build and test log from a successful run (e.g. build-log.txt). To capture: run the CI workflow (after copying `02-ci-pipeline/ci.yml` to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`), open the completed run in the Actions tab, then copy or download the log and save it here.
